FoxWorth Edition is TravTube's special version of Minecraft. 
It's run with Fabric API, and the main mod is Essential. 
If you beat the dragon, the end poem is different, and there's LOORRREE! 
Coming soon! It has a collection of mods, and resource packs that make the game more enjoyable, and exciting to play.
A resource pack that I created has been made to change the menu to look more of the FoxWorth Edition Color's. 
And with shaders, it can boost up the look and feel of the game.
